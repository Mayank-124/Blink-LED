# How to contribute
- Create a pull request that adds a new `Blink LED` program.
- The new file must be named `<μC_name>.<extension>`
  - Please, use **first letter** of the file name in uppercase.
  - Place the file in the right folder inside `examples`.
  - Please **no new files on the root directory!**.
  
- Only one new change  per pull request either change the μC or language or way, please.
- Don't add existing Blink LED programs to the repo. You can see them in examples folder.

  - If there's already an entry for the μC using particular language, and you're adding a significantly different "Blink LED",then you can add `_2`, `_3`.. etc to the end of the file name.

## I will merge your pull request as long as it is valid. It might takes about 24 hours.
